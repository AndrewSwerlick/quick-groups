# Quick Groups 

A simple chrome extension to make it easier to manage tab gruops. Provides the following functionality

* Open a tab group from any bookmark folder under a folder named "Groups"
* Close all tabs not currently in a group

Built to enable a particular workflow around tab groups that I prefer
